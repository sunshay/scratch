# to write a variable in python
#you have to consider letters or strins(characters). eg, a,b,c , or firstname.
#on variable declarations....
x = 3
print "the value for x is "+ str(x) #this converts the value of x to str..
#this is because python can not print integer value with a string the same time in one line.
#you have to convert it to string so that it can interpret.
