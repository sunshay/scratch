#operators gives us chance to deal with different operands .
"""
we have different types of operators, etc,
assignment operators,
increment and decrement operators,
logic operators,
arithmetic operators
"""
#================> arithmetic operators ==============
#this deals with additions , subtraction, division, multiplication, modules of a number..
a = 4
b = 5
c = a + b
print c #this is addion..
c = a-b
print c #sub
c = a/b
print # division.
c = a * b
print c # multiplication..


print "=====================working with relational operators..."
if(a > b):
    print "A is greater than B"
else:
    print "B is greater than A"
