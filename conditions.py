#conditional statements with python...
#here we are learning about how to use python if statements with operators having operants.
#eg.
a = 5
b = 8
if(a > b):
    print "A is greater than B"
    #this statement improves that A is greater than B in condition A is greater.
else:
    print"B is greater than A"
    #this is not a condition, it is a statement, printed out only when A is smaller than B.
